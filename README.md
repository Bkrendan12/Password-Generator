# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator


Motivation

I wanted to give the user the option of generating a new randomized password with the criteria they choose. You can choose to include numbers, special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters in your generated password, as long as it's between 8 and 128 characters.

Tech/framework used

This webpage was created using basic html and css. I used flexbox to design the pages layout, media queries and css variables.

Built with

--html --css

How to use?

This is a very standard and simple formatted "about me" page introducing myself and showcasing the projects I have created and worked on.

When you open the webpage, You'll be greeted with a header at the top of the browser. Underneath is a very simple and intuitive navigation bar that allows you to automatically scroll to the section of the page you would like to view. The page includes a description about me, the projects I have created, a hobby of mine that explains other creative interests that tie to web design and a section where you can contact me via email, my github repositories and my social media pages.

And that's it! A page where you can get to know me and view the creative side of my personality.

Contribute:

If you'd like a simple layout to your "about me" page, you're more than welcome to use mine as a starting off template.
