Project title
# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Motivation

I wanted to give the user the option of generating a new randomized password with the criteria they choose. You can choose to include numbers, special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters in your generated password, as long as it's between 8 and 128 characters.

Tech/framework used

This webpage was created using basic html, css and Javascript.

Built with

--index.html --style.css --script.js

How to use?

This is a password generator that gives you a new randomized password for the user. It's just a demonstration, so you wont be able to use this password for anything outside of this page.

When you open the webpage, You'll have the option to click on the "generate password" button. It will then prompt you to give the desired length of your password and the number is required to be between 8 and 128 characters AND it can't be any other characters other than a number or you will get a message asking for a number between 8 and 128 or telling you to only include a number and cancel the prompt window which you will again need to click on the button to start over.

After you you choose your length correctly, you'll be prompted to choose to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters (in that order) in your generated password.

the "ok" in your last prompt question, which will be if you want to include special characters will end the prompts and you'll be given your new password in the window.

Contribute:

I plan on adding more functionality to this like storing it in local storage and being able to use this new password outside of this site for use. 

If you would like to do the same, youre welcome to use this as starter code.
